# Zewail Campus Can collector
## Project Description

The Zewail Campus Can collector is a reinforcement learning project where an agent is tasked with efficiently picking up and delivering cans within the Zewaail Campus (ZC). The agent starts at the main gate of ZC and must navigate to two pickup locations: NB (Nano Building) and HB (Helmy Building). At each pickup location, there are four items to be delivered. The agent then needs to deliver these items to two drop-off locations: AB (Academic Building) and One-stop-shop.

The goal of this project is to train the agent to complete this task with the minimum number of steps, using reinforcement learning techniques.
